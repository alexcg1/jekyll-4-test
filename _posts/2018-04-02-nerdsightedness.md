With all the questions about ethics and technology lately, especially Facebook data collection and Cambridge Analytica, it seems a good time to introduce the concept of _Nerdsightnedness_:

> _n._ The inability to see beyond a technologyâ€™s interesting technical aspects, particularly to miss its ethical implications; to see the world from the perspective of a nerd. 

Or, as Jurassic Park put it:

> Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn&#8217;t stop to think if they should!
