Script_buddy has done it again. Kirk and Spock drinking beer and having awkward conversations about airports. You can cut the sexual tension with a knife. It's a perfect [slashfic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction).

I'm still not quite sure how much of this output is from the Star Trek stuff I'm feeding in to script_buddy, and how much is it just riffing on material from the Internet Movie Scripts Database (which it's been pre-trained on). I've written a script to create a more structured version of the Star Trek data and will try feeding that in over the next few days.

Now, without further ado:

**Starting text:** `Kirk to Spock`

### The Script

>Kirk sits at his desk. In response to Spock's question, which seems at first confused, he takes a sip of water from a paper cup he's putting away.
>
>KIRK I'm thirsty.
>
>SPOCK I'll be on my way now.
>
>He nods, then looks at the desk again. It's empty.
>
>SPOCK (CONT'D) (to himself) Oh. Damn.
>
>Spock walks over to the kitchenette.
>
>KIRK I guess we're ready for dinner.
>
>He picks up a bottle of beer from the fridge.
>
>
>INT. KIRK'S KITCHENET.
>
>Spock walks in the kitchen.
>
>
>SPOCK (to himself) I'm all out of beer! I'm done!
>
>He goes to Kirk as he's sitting up. The doctor is about to say something to Kirk when, with faint surprise, he looks at the fridge and finds a bottle of Budweiser on the shelf.
>
>
>INT. KIRK'S KITCHEN.
>
>Spock sits down, with a beer in hand.

>KIRK (laughing) We must really have been in a long line of students at the airport.
>

>
>
>KIRK (continuing) I'm sorry if that was a bit awkward.
>
>
>SPOCK (continuing) I'm just a little anxious. We just need to talk about the flight. I could always make it back later.
