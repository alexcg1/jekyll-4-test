I&#8217;ve recently been putting a lot of hours into levelling up my computer science and coding, mostly covering Python, Tensorflow, machine learning, and a few little projects to scratch personal itches.

Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve got a nice little workflow going. Here are some of the things I do:

## Make the Most of Free Resources

I&#8217;ve been using [Coursera](http://www.coursera) for their course on [Nand2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer), and [MIT&#8217;s Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/) for their courses on Python and data science. I&#8217;m especially a fan of MIT&#8217;s offering because it doesn&#8217;t ask for you to sign up &#8211; something that&#8217;s more of a concern in these days of massive Facebook data breaches.

## Pop Out Youtube Videos

While the above sites are good, I have to keep their page open in my browser to view the video on my laptop screen. Luckily MIT&#8217;s videos are all on Youtube too, so I use the [Youtube Popout Player](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-popout-player/?src=search) extension for Firefox. With that, and my Linux desktop allowing me to keep certain windows on top, I can play the video in the corner of my desktop while focusing on the code in my editor.

## Use Jupyter Notebook

I&#8217;d played with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) a fair bit before, but didn&#8217;t really see the point. Why bother when I have [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)?

But since we use Jupyter at Remix, I thought I should play with it a bit more, and I&#8217;m starting to fall in love, especially with their tab completion and special commands. It&#8217;s a bit of a pain to set up if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with [Docker](http://docker.com) or the command line, but well worth it. Having said that, I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s great for everything. Learning coding and data science? Sure. Building programs that do file IO, web serving, or need GUIs? Maybe not so much.

Now I&#8217;ve started playing with [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), the next generation of Jupyter Notebook. It&#8217;s even more of an IDE, and I&#8217;m just getting started learning the new features. So far, so good!
