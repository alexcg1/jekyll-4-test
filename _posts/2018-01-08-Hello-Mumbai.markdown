I'm super excited to be heading to [Maker Mela](http://www.makermela.com/) in Mumbai in a few days. My first time in India and I'm looking forward to meeting the local maker community!

I'll be showcasing some of the projects I've been working on, potentially including:

* **Cyborg Beast prosthetic hand** - a 3D-printable open-source prosthetic
* **K8e** - a voice-activated robot pet dog, still very much a work-in-progress
* **[SpaceGAMBIT](http://www.spacegambit.org)**

Can't wait to see you all there!
