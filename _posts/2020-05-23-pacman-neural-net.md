Just had to share this really cool use of [GANs to create new game levels with no underlying knowledge of a game engine](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/22/gamegan-research-pacman-anniversary/)

Now instead of Inky, Pinky, Binky and Clyde, I'm thinking of how cool it would be to do this with Mario. After all, [Super Mario Maker](https://supermariomaker.nintendo.com/) is already a thing humans can use to build new levels. How cool would it be for a GAN to do that?
