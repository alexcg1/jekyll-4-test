Yesterday I gave a workshop on building an AI-powered meme search engine using [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/) to about 200 folks from [Google Student Developer Clubs](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc) around India. I'll drop the video here once it's up, but in the meantime here's the Python notebook that explains everything you need to know about building an AI-powered text search engine for memes (note: *text* search engine. My prior post was about testing models for searching meme *images*)

- [Google Colab version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jina-ai/workshops/blob/main/memes/meme_search.ipynb)
- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jina-ai/workshops/tree/main/memes)
- Live demo with 30k indexed memes on [Jina's examples site](http://examples.jina.ai/)

Pull requests and issues are always welcome!
