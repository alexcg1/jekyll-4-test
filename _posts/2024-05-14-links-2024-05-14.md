### [MSX History: The Platform Microsoft Forgot](https://tedium.co/2019/01/29/microsoft-msx-history/)

Today in Tedium: When Microsoft revealed that it was finally putting its long-running, if disregarded, Windows Phone line out to pasture , it was less roar, more whimper. It was a valiant effort that introduced some original thinking to the smartphone space, but it ultimately was a noble failure. But it got me thinking about a platform with Microsoft’s fingerprints on it, that was a noble and influential attempt at producing a standard, but ultimately fell into obscurity, with the industry choosing a different path. Today’s Tedium is about the Windows Phone of the ’80s, MSX. (Wait, MSX?) — Ernie @ Tedium
