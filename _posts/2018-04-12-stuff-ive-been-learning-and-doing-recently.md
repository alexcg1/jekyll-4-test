## Object-Oriented Python

I&#8217;ve been programming for quite a long time, but always in an ad-hoc, pick-it-up-as-I-go fashion to fix a specific problem I was having. That generally meant procedural programming, and relying on copy-pasting examples to use anything like objects. But in the past week or so I really focused on upping my game. I&#8217;ll be using objects a lot more from now on &#8211; I can&#8217;t believe it took me this long to get into it!

I can really recommend [MIT&#8217;s 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) if you want to learn this stuff yourself.

## PowerPoint Translation Utility

Using my new object-oriented superpowers, I put together a [quick and dirty command line utility to translate PowerPoint files from one language to another](https://github.com/alexcg1/transppt/). Very useful for dealing with Chinese PowerPoints sent by my colleagues! Not perfect yet, but translated about 80% of an example PPT.

## NumPy and Pandas

A couple of Python libraries for scientific computing and dealing with matrices and tables of data. I&#8217;ve been trying to muck about with TensorFlow recently, but not getting far. Understanding these more fundamental mathematical libraries helps a lot.

## Jupyter Notebooks and ipython

[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is a nice way of testing out Python programming and libraries. Lots of autocomplete and help functionality, and runs in my terminal. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is the web-based successor, but means a bit more overhead and faff to set up. Now I need to see how to get ipython working with Python 3

## Flower Classifier

I built a flower classifier using TensorFlow. Well, when I say &#8220;built&#8221;, more &#8220;followed instructions&#8221;. I&#8217;m planning on digging much deeper in TensorFlow in the coming weeks.

## NAND2Tetris

[NAND2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) is a course that teaches you to build a modern computer from first principles, starting at the most basic logic gates. It&#8217;s a lot to take in &#8211; Boolean algebra, assembly code, multiple levels of abstraction, &c &c. I&#8217;m taking a break from it for a little bit to focus on higher level stuff (some of which I described above), but relish the chance to get back to this course.
