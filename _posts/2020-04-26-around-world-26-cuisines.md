Over the course of the lockdown, I've been working, coding, sleeping, and binging [Legends of Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_Tomorrow). I've also been doing a lot of cooking, especially with my slow cooker.

With that in mind (and not much else to occupy us), my bubble buddies and I have decided upon a challenge. We're going to cook a different dish each day (who am I kidding, whenever we feel like it), and each dish will be from a country starting with a different letter. Dish one will start with 'A', dish two with 'B', and so on.

## Ground Rules

* Try to find a dish from a country we know very little about. I'm a New Zealander, so I'd be more interested to try Argentina, Armenia, or Angola, rather than Australia for example.
* Make sure it's a dish where we can easily get the ingredients and equipment.
* Since I love my slow cooker, make sure I can use that where possible. If not, I'll just do whatever recipe sounds straightfoward.
* One of my bubble buddies doesn't eat red meat, so go with chicken or vegetarian options where possible.

Today, we're kicking off with:

## Angola: Slow Cooker Chicken Muamba

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola):

> Angola is a country on the west coast of Southern Africa. It is the seventh-largest country in Africa, bordered by Namibia to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Zambia to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Angola has an exclave province, the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda.
