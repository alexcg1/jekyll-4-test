Want to learn how to code smart contracts and Dapps with Ethereum? Try out [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/). It's by far one of the best tutorials I've found for getting a basic feel for Solidity and how it differs from other languages. I've been through the whole thing myself, and had a great time building my unstoppable zombie horde along the way.

Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with Cryptozombies or CleverFlare - I just know good resources when I see them!

Dislaimer 2: I'm not sure if the [release of Solidity 0.6.0](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases) introduces any breaking changes compared to what you learn in the course. Even so, it's still good for getting your bearings with the language (and building a fun deck of zombie cards)
