One of the reasons I was invited to be part of the Remix team is because I&#8217;m a geek and a maker, as I&#8217;m sure many of our users are. With that in mind, here are a bunch of links that I find useful as a geek, maker, and technologist/futurist in general:

  * **[Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com)** &#8211; a roundup of all the latest tech news, gathered by members of the Y Combinator community.
  * **[Lobste.rs](http://www.lobste.rs)** &#8211; similar to Hacker News, but smaller. Still has some interesting daily links though.
  * **[Boingboing](http://boingboing.net/), [Kottke](http://www.kottke.org) and [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com)** &#8211; Three blogs that have been going forever. They cover all sorts of things, including (but certainly not limited to) maker culture, technology and digital rights.
  * **[io9](http://io9.gizmodo.com)** &#8211; Without the inspiration of science fiction you wouldn&#8217;t have your shiny iPad or iPhone. io9 collects the latest news about sci-fi books, movies, and TV.
  * **[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com)** &#8211; Reddit is a community-determined aggregator of content. It is a social platform where users submit posts that other users &#8216;upvote&#8217; or &#8216;downvote&#8217; based on if they like it. I follow just a few subreddits including [opensource](http://www.reddit.com/r/opensource), [askscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience), and [askhistorians](http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians)
