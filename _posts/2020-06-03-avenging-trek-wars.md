Script buddy has now absorbed most of Star Trek TNG, DS9, and the movies! It's also done it's first crossover, which I certainly wasn't expecting. Love that it's got the Borg, Romulans, AND Thor. Stoik sounds like kind of a Vulcan name and it's hilarious he goes for a lightsaber rather than a nerve pinch.

Starting text: "Picard to Riker."


> STARK
> Commander, I beg you, don't fire at a moving target.
> 
> BORG
> If you insist, Stark. We have an emergency, and if we're not careful we could find ourselves hunted by the Romulans in a matter of days...
> 
> Stoick looks at Stark, confused, then back at the bridge.
> 
> STARK
> I'm the one who said we could do it, Troi. Stoick just nods.
> 
> STARK
> We are doing it, you are.
> 
> Stoick smiles, pulls out his lightsaber. He raises it to his eye as Borsk.
> 
> They move through the ship. It pulls up beside the transport tower.
> 
> Thor crosses to the side of the walkway, sees the approaching transport.
> 
> 
> THOR
> There's a transport, there's a Romulan transport, there's the bridge... they're coming...
> 
> The bridge is just visible from across the bridge.

(CONTINUED)

It's not really continued. It just decided that was a good place to put the string CONTINUED and end the script.
