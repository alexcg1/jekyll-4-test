Just a heads up that I've installed [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) on my site. It's an open-source package and all running self-hosted on my cloud server. Since many of you have an adblocker installed (or uMatrix if you're <strike>paranoid</strike> sensible) it likely won't affect you at all (uBlock Origin blocks it by default).
