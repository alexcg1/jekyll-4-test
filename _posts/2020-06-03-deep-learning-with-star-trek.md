I've been thinking lately, that sooner or later it'll be possible to create TV episodes with deep learning. Just look at the tech we already have:

* [GPT-3](https://towardsdatascience.com/gpt-3-the-new-mighty-language-model-from-openai-a74ff35346fc?gi=ffae41ed01d5) - text generation that is getting on for human-level quality
* [Deepfake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) - mapping one actor's face onto footage from a different actor
* [Real Time Voice Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning#pretrained-models) - does what it says on the tin

Today, many of the above technologies are still in their infancy, and I'm not confident we could re-create an episode of say, *Star Trek*, that would fool anybody. But we can create a janky knock-off just for the hell of it. Think of it as like [B-4](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/B-4), the less bright younger brother of Lieutenant Commander Data.

Now, if we're creating a TV show, the first thing we need is a script. I used [script buddy v2](https://github.com/cdpierse/script_buddy_v2), a film script text generation tool. It was a pain in the ass to get it up and running (I'm looking at you `pip install torch` and your not being able to find a version on Pypi that *clearly exists*) but I got there in the end. It's even got a pretty graphical interface:

I haven't yet fine-tuned it for Star Trek (that'll be for a future post), but here's what I got when I used "Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no man has gone before!" as the starting point:

### Star Trek: The Ruth of Kahn (Yeah, that's the title I'm giving it)

> And now they start to dance. She's a very good dancer. RUTH is smiling a lot, and she does a lot of hip moves. Her audience is very supportive, giving her credit for having a good time. This is a big moment for the audience.

### Thoughts

I mean it's not great, and it's not Star Trek, yet but it's not completely bad:

#### The Good

* It clearly picked up on the space angle with its mentions of Jupiter
* I dig the cinematic opening with the solar flare and planet turning to glass

#### The Ridiculous

* The Enterprise completed Starfleet's mission pretty damn early, right in the first few lines it's already boldly gone and done it
* A dance studio? I guess it could be in a holodeck??
* It's very fourth wall breaking, really using the audience as characters
* And all this focus on Ruth! She's clearly the heroine, using her low-rent country-style singing to explore the universe
